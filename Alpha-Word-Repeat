	 Let's write a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order. OK? 
=end

puts "Type in as many words as you want"
input = gets.chomp

array = input.split(" ")

puts array.sort

=begin ELEGANT SOLUTION
input1 = [ ]
input = "x"
 
while input != ""
  input = gets.chomp
  input1.push(input)
end
puts
puts input1.sort
=end
